Welcome to my GitHub. I am currently a master student in Computer Science at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). My research lies at the intersection of **computer vision** and **3D Reconstrution** â€“ with a special focus on building intelligent visual systems that are continual and data-efficient. If you have any questions on my projects, please feel free to [send me an email](mailto:falcary@outlook.com).
